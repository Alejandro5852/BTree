## Balanced Tree (incomplete)



BMain.java is the main method and entry point for prgram.
This is the only file you will need to run.  You will be interacting with console to input values and terminate program.
If you will be running from command line then move files to folder where javac can be reached.

## Run
- clone repo  
- simply do `javac filename.java` on each file and then do
- do `java BMain` to run program.

## Limitations
1. This program is currently limited to only handle integers.  
2. Node with key value 0 is 'empty'.
3. Only deletes from leaf nodes.
